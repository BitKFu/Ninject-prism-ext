Prism.NinjectExtension 

This extension is for use with the Microsoft.Practices.Prism library.

The current version requires the following:
 - Microsoft.Practices.Prism 4.0
 - Ninject 2.2
 
 To use:
 
 1) replace UnityBootstrapper or MEFBootstrapper with NinjectBootstrapper.
 2) in Module construct, use Ninject.IKernel instead of IUnityContainer or CompositionContainer 
 3) replace IUnityContainer and CompositionContainer type registration with Ninject bindings


I plan to update this soon for both silverlight and WP7 apps (if possible)
